<h1>Hospital infections</h1>
<h3>Ronald Campbell<br>
CHCF Center for Health Reporting</h3>
<p>
<p>Beginning in October 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began fining hospitals for certain hospital-acquired infections. Hospitals were graded on a scale from 1 (best) to 10 (worst). The worst 25 percent, those with a score of 7 or higher, were docked 1 percent of their Medicare reimbursement for the federal 2014-2015 fiscal year.</>
<p>I've collected information about the fines here. If you have questions, email me at <a href="mailto:rwcampbe@usc.edu">rwcampbe@usc.edu</a>, and please share stories with me on Twitter @campbellronaldw</p>
